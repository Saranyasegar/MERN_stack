Learning Goal: Master Full-Stack Web Development using the MERN Stack

Project Overview

This repository documents my structured 15-day learning journey to understand and implement the MERN Stack for full-stack web development.

The MERN stack is a JavaScript-based technology stack that includes:

- MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing application data
- Express.js– Backend framework for building RESTful APIs
- React.js – Frontend library for building user interfaces
- Node.js– JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development

The goal of this repository is to track daily progress, concepts learned, and practical implementation experience.

---

Objectives of Learning MERN Stack

- Understand full-stack web development architecture
- Gain proficiency in JavaScript (frontend and backend)
- Build responsive user interfaces using React.js
- Develop RESTful APIs using Express.js
- Handle server-side logic using Node.js
- Perform CRUD operations using MongoDB
- Integrate frontend and backend systems
- Debug effectively using documentation and developer communities
- Deploy a complete MERN stack application

Role of Stack Overflow in Learning

Stack Overflow plays an important role in the development process by:

- Providing solutions to real-world coding problems
- Helping debug errors efficiently
- Offering best practices and optimization techniques
- Supporting continuous learning through community discussions

It is an essential resource throughout this learning journey.

15-Day Learning Plan & Progress

Day 1 – Introduction to MERN Stack Fundamentals

Topics Covered

- What is Full-Stack Development?
- Introduction to MERN Architecture
- Overview of:
  - MongoDB
  - Express.js
  - React.js
  - Node.js

- Understanding how frontend, backend, and database interact
- Installation and Setup:
  - Node.js
  - VS Code
  - MongoDB (Local / MongoDB Atlas)
  - Git

- Creating and running a basic Node.js server
- Understanding project structure

Key Takeaways
